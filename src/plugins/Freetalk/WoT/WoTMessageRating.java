/**
 * A rating for a WoTMessage.
 * 
 * It is an additive adjustment of the trust value of an identity.
 * For example if your own identity has assigned a trust value of 30 to identity X and you assign a 
 * WoTMessageRating with a value of 10 to the identity it will get a trust value of 40.
 * 
 * Freetalk does not allow the storage of a new rating which would cause the trust value to exceed the -100 or +100 lower/upper limit.<br />
 * This must be handled this way:<br />
 * The UI must allow reverting of ratings. Reverting a positive rating is equal to subtraction of the given points.<br />
 * If storage of ratings was allowed where the total sum would be > 100, reverting all ratings would result in the target identity being distrusted,
 * even though all removed ratings were positive - if all removed ratings were positive the resulting trust value should be neutral, not negative.<br />
 * The same applies for negative ratings with flipped signs.<br />
 * This means that the checkedCommit() function throws a RuntimeException in case of a not allow rating.<br />
 * It must happen at the commit stage and not in the storeWithoutCommit function because storing can be aborted by rollback at any point
 * and the handling in the rollback function would be complicated because it would have to check whether the rating was already applied.<br /><br />
 * 
 * There, there is an IMPORTANT restriction of class WoTMessageRating: Only commit transactions using the WoTMessageRating.commit()
 * function, do not use the static version of this function!
