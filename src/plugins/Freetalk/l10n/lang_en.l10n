CreateIdentityWizard.RetryButton=Try creating identity again
CreateIdentityWizard.Step1.Header=Step 1 of 3: Choose the SSK URI
CreateIdentityWizard.Step1.Text=The SSK URI of your identity is a public-private key pair that uniquely identifies your identity on the network. You can either let Freenet generate a new, random one for you or enter an existing SSK URI pair. For example, if you own a Freesite you can re-use its URI to show others that your identity belongs to your Freesite.
CreateIdentityWizard.Step1.GenerateNewKeyPairRadio=Generate a new, random SSK key pair for the identity.

CreateIdentityWizard.Step3.Header=Step 3 of 3: Choose your preferences
CreateIdentityWizard.Step3.TrustList.Header=Trust list
CreateIdentityWizard.Step3.TrustList.Text1=Trust lists are the ${bold}fundament of Freetalk${/bold}. You can publish a ${bold}trust value${/bold} for other users' identities in your trust list. The trust value can be between -100 and +100 inclusive and is a measurement for how valuable you rate the messages of an identity. If someone posts spam, you can assign a negative trust value. If someone writes useful posts, you can assign a positive one.
CreateIdentityWizard.Step3.TrustList.Text2=Freetalk will accumulate trust values from other identities' trust lists and calculate from them a ${bold}score${/bold} (weighted average) for every identity. If the score of an identity is negative, Freetalk will not download new messages from that identity unless you tell it to do so. The purpose of the trust system is to ${bold}prevent spam${/bold} but it is ${bold}not to punish authors for having a different opinion than yours${/bold}. Please respect that when assigning trust values.
CreateIdentityWizard.Step3.TrustList.Text3=Here you can choose whether Freetalk should publish a trust list for your identity. It is generally a good idea because it helps the other users. However you can tell Freetalk not to publish your trust list if you are concerned that it might compromise your anonymity because the trust values among several of your identities might be similar.
CreateIdentityWizard.Step3.TrustList.Text4=${bold}Warning:${/bold} The etiquette of Freenet forbids censorship, negative trust values shall only be given if someone posts spam. In opposite to this, it is possible that your local laws require you to remove illegal content if you have the technical ability to do so. Those laws could result in punishment if you do not publish a trust list which censors publishers of illegal content by distrust. Because of this we recommend you not to tell anyone in real-life which Freetalk identities you are using. 
CreateIdentityWizard.Step3.TrustList.PublishTrustListCheckbox=Publish this identity's trust list
CreateIdentityWizard.Step4.Header=Identity created
CreateIdentityWizard.Step4.Success=Your identity was successfully created. You can now log in with it.

LoginPage.Welcome.Header=Welcome to Freetalk
LoginPage.Welcome.Text1=Freetalk is a pseudo-anonymous messaging system based on Freenet. It is very similar to Internet forums and newsgroups. Pseudo-anonymous means that you post your messages using an 'identity' which is uniquely identified by its Freetalk address which consists of a nickname and a unique cryptographic key.
LoginPage.Welcome.Text2=Because you can keep the private part of the cryptographic key (the insert URI) secret, only you can post as your Freetalk identity, which means that everyone knows that all messages from your identity probably come from the same author. Therefore, you are ${bold}pseudo${/bold}-anonymous.
LoginPage.Welcome.Text3=Due to the nature of Freenet, nobody will know who is inserting the messages from your identity, which means that you as a real person are still an ${bold}anonymous author${/bold}.

NewBoardPage.NewBoardBox.Text2=${bold}Warning:${/bold} The abuse of board creation can cause users to distrust your identity. Please try not to create duplicate boards, boards with inappropriate names or boards which do not fit into the existing hierarchy of "." levels. If you are a new user please give Freetalk some hours to fetch the full board list before you use it to decide whether new boards are needed. 
NewBoardPage.NewBoardBox.LanguageBox.Header=Language
NewBoardPage.NewBoardBox.LanguageBox.Text=The board name will be prefixed with the following language code
NewBoardPage.NewBoardBox.BoardNameBox.Header=Board name
